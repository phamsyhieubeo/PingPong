# Ping Pong Game

## Overview

This project is a Ping Pong game built using Python's `turtle` and `tkinter` libraries. The game offers a simple interface where players can control paddles to play a classic Pong-style game. Players can also adjust game settings and learn how to play from the main menu. 

## Features

- **Main Menu**: Start the game, access settings, or learn how to play from the intuitive main menu.
- **Paddle Control**: Player A uses `W` and `S` keys, while Player B uses the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to move the paddles.
- **Settings**: Change the ball shape to either a square or circle.
- **Game Controls**:
  - `W/Up` for moving paddles up
  - `S/Down` for moving paddles down
  - `R` to reset the game
  - `ESC` to quit the game

## Dependencies

- `turtle`: Used for creating the game's graphics and animations.
- `tkinter`: Provides the GUI interface for the main menu and settings.
- `json`: To load and store game settings such as ball shape.

## How to Play

1. Open the main menu to start the game.
2. Control paddles with the following keys:
   - Player A: `W` to move up, `S` to move down.
   - Player B: `Up Arrow` to move up, `Down Arrow` to move down.
3. The ball bounces off the top and bottom edges of the window. If the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player scores.
4. First player to a set number of points (or time) wins the game.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Ensure that Python and the required libraries (`turtle`, `tkinter`, `json`) are installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the project folder and run the game:
   python <filename>.py

## Game Controls

- **W/Up**: Move the paddle up.
- **S/Down**: Move the paddle down.
- **R**: Reset the game score and the ball position.
- **ESC**: Quit the game.

## Settings

You can customize the ball's shape in the **Settings** menu:

- Ball Shape: Choose between a `square` or `circle`.

The settings are saved in the `Setting/Setting.json` file, and changes made in the settings menu are stored for future games.

## How to Modify

If you want to modify the game:

- **Game Settings**: You can adjust ball behavior, speed, and more by editing the game logic in the `GamePlay()` function.
- **Menu Customization**: The `tkinter` interface allows for simple customization of buttons, labels, and other widgets in the `main_menu()` function.
- **Settings File**: The game settings are stored in `Setting/Setting.json`. You can manually edit this file to change settings like ball shape without using the in-game menu.
