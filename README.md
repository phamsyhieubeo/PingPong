# Ping Pong Game

## Overview

This is a simple Ping Pong game made with Python. You can control paddles and hit the ball, just like in the old Pong games. You can also change settings, and the game has a menu to help you start or learn how to play.

## Features

- **Main Menu**: Start the game, go to settings, or see how to play.
- **Paddle Controls**: 
  - Player A: Use `W` to move up and `S` to move down.
  - Player B: Use the `Up Arrow` to move up and the `Down Arrow` to move down.
- **Settings**: You can change the shape of the ball (either a square or a circle).
- **Other Controls**:
  - Press `R` to reset the game.
  - Press `ESC` to quit the game.

## How to Play

1. Open the main menu and click "Start" to begin the game.
2. Player A uses the `W` and `S` keys to move the paddle.
3. Player B uses the `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` keys to move the paddle.
4. The ball will bounce off the top and bottom walls. If it goes past a paddle, the other player gets a point.
5. The scores are shown at the top of the screen.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this project:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
3. Run the game with:
   `python <filename>.py`

## Game Controls

- **W/Up Arrow**: Move the paddle up.
- **S/Down Arrow**: Move the paddle down.
- **R**: Reset the game score.
- **ESC**: Exit the game.

## Settings

You can change the shape of the ball in the **Settings** menu. The options are:
- **Square**
- **Circle**

The settings are saved in a file called `Setting.json`, so they will stay the same next time you play.

## How to Change the Game

- You can change the speed of the ball or other things in the game by editing the code.
- The main menu and settings can also be changed easily by modifying the `main_menu()` function in the code.
- You can also change the settings in the `Setting/Setting.json` file to directly adjust the ball shape or other options.
